### Relational Databases

A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. Relational databases store data in a series of tables. Interconnections between the tables are specified as foreign keys. A foreign key is a unique reference from one row in a relational table to another row in a table, which can be the same table but is most commonly a different table.
